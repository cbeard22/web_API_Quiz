# Web API Quiz

#Description
This assignment was to create a multiple choice quiz that allowed the user to click an answer and be brought to the next question. The timer will count down and their score will be the time remaining on the clock. The user then can log their initials to keep track of the high scores that are saved in the local storage. 

#Use
To start the quiz. Load the index.html and click the start button. When the start button is clicked the timer will start and the questions will appear. As soon as the user is finished with the quiz they will be brought to the high scores page where they can log their initials.
